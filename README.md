# Javascript-Projects
This repository is where I will be pushing all of my projects for my Javascript course.

<h1>Projects</h1>
  <p><ul>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/Vransom/HTML-and-CSS-projects/blob/main/bootstrap4_project/academy_cinemas.html">Tic-Tac-Toe Game</a></li>

  </ul></p>

<h2>PIzza Menu</h2>
<p> This project is a basic pizza menu where users can enter their pizza size and select toppings. The program will then list what they ordered and how much it costs.</p>

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
<p>This is a game of tic-tac-toe where users can play (and hopefully win) against a computer. I've added different sounds to show a tie game and the winner is celebrated.</p>

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>This was another project we worked on to practice Javascript. It is a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>There are many other drills located in this repository, however the three above are the ones that I am most proud of. Can't wait to learn more!</p>
